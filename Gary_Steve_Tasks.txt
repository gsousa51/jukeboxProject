valid logins/users/valid minutes
songqueue - data structure, run(), observer

*note - when actually playing songs, call songChosen in jukebox

for checking song/account, they will return null if the thing is NOT in the
account

** in logic unit, make sure to set current user ,log them out
because our current user is stored in the accountcollection


Dots in password field instead of asterisks - is that possible?


** For iteration 2 - steve consider refactoring requestSong[1-2] methods in the
buttonPanel into 
one method, passing the song in
